# SQL-ZOO

These are my answers to the challenges from the SQL ZOO tutorial that can be found at https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial.

Through solving these challenges, I learned:

1) How to work with a relational database management system using SQL.
2) How to create and execute regular and nested queries using SELECT.
3) How to create and manage a database.
4) How to use aggregate function and GROUP BY
5) How to JOIN two or more tables together using INNER/OUTER/SELF JOIN.
6) The benefits of using a SQL database for faster processing while using a framework like Ruby on Rails.
